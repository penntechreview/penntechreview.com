          <p class="card-text mb-auto">Marketing is absolutely essential to Penn Tech Review. It's the difference between getting 100 views on a release and 5000 (literally). It's our vehicle for distributing articles, establishing our brand, and helping forward our goal of connecting undergraduates with Philadelphia's technology community. We need students with concrete marketing experience and a drive to grow organizations. Our marketing team helps grow our brand's presence in Philadelphia through organizing events, creating engaging content, and understanding our analytics to see where we can improve. <br />  <br />  This application is technically due at midnight on Saturday, September 22nd but we understand that things happen, so please submit this before any reasonable person would wake up on the following day.</p>
