        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem"> Those who first encounter  Professor Rajiv Gandhi, with his steadfast composure and characteristic solid-colored polos, may find him simple and quiet. However, Rajiv has a hidden energy - one that allows him to memorize all students’ names across 200-person classes and one that materializes as he teaches Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (CIS 160) and Algorithms and Data Structures (CIS 121) at the University of Pennsylvania. We sat down with Professor Gandhi to learn more about his childhood, his path to academia, his advice to students, and more.
        We asked, “Rajiv, if you didn’t go down the computer science path, what do you think you’d be doing?”</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem">Yes, Rajiv Gandhi was a table tennis enthusiast in his childhood days. In fact, with hard work and dedication, Rajiv ranked 6th nationally at the age of 14. He practiced hours each day and even inspired others in his town to be competitively involved with the sport. He added, 

          “I wanted to help other players achieve success in table tennis. When I was young and started playing, there was no one in my vicinity playing table tennis, but once I started, about 10 to 12 kids in my immediate locality started playing. I would say that I had a small part to play in inspiring them to take up the sport.”
      
      A drive to help others is a common theme we see throughout our conversation with Professor Gandhi; it purposes his strong work ethic. Although he was obsessed with the sport, Rajiv’s parents encouraged him to focus on his academics; eventually, he had to quit. </p>
    
      <p>
          Rajiv then applied his strong work ethic to academics. After completing his bachelor's in India, he came to the United States, completed a master’s in computer networking, and then worked at Qualcomm. Rajiv mentioned, “it became very clear after being in industry that I wanted to go into academia.” Naturally, we questioned what initially drew Rajiv to computer science, to a Ph.D. in the field, and eventually to instruction. His answer caught us a bit off-guard:
